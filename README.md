We are finding it difficult to upload an image file to github.As a result,we are currently not able to submit our entire folder on github since our assignment contained files of .jpg format too.I was informed that we could do the same using the github for windows program but it is running a bit too sluggish on my computer.So,the only solution i can figure out at the moment to submit before the deadline is to upload all the files on google drive and share it.we apologize for not figuring out this earlier.We hope this wouldn't be a problem and have any effect on the evaluation.

The link for the files in google drive is given below ,
